# 🌦️ Rainfall Prediction Using Machine Learning  

This project predicts whether it will rain tomorrow or not, based on real-world weather data and machine learning models.  
The pipeline includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and deployment with a Flask API accessible via an ngrok tunnel.

## 📂 Project Workflow  

### 1️⃣ Dataset Preparation  
- Collected weather data with features like temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation, clouds, ozone, etc.  
- Removed unnecessary columns (like description).  
- Applied One-Hot Encoding for categorical variables (city, weather conditions).  
- Applied Label Encoding where necessary.  
- Normalized numerical features using **StandardScaler**.  
- Handled class imbalance using **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)**.  

### 2️⃣ Model Training  
- Trained multiple models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.  
- **XGBoost outperformed others with 100% accuracy** on the test set.  
- Saved the trained model and preprocessing objects (`xgb_model_1.pkl`, `standard_scaler.pkl`, encoders).  

### 3️⃣ Feature Importance  
- Used Random Forest to identify most important weather predictors.  
- Top features included: **precipitation, probability of precipitation (pop), mid-level clouds**.  

### 4️⃣ Deployment  
- Built a **Flask backend** that loads the trained model and preprocessors.  
- Created a **frontend (HTML + JavaScript)** for users to enter a city name and check if it will rain tomorrow.  
- Connected Flask API with **ngrok tunnel** to make it accessible over the internet.

## 🖥️ Tech Stack  
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, imbalanced-learn, joblib)  
- Flask for backend  
- HTML + CSS + JavaScript for frontend  
- Ngrok for deployment

## 🚀 How It Works  
1. User enters a city name in the web interface.  
2. Flask backend fetches the corresponding weather features and applies preprocessing (scaling + encoding).  
3. Trained XGBoost model makes the rainfall prediction.  
4. Result is displayed with an icon:  
   - ☔ **Rain Expected**  
   - 🌞 **No Rain Expected**
